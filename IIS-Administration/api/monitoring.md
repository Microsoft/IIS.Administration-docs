# Monitoring

The monitoring API provides performance and health data for the web server, web sites, and application pools. This data can be used to measure how effectively resources are being used. 

## Web Server Monitoring (/api/webserver/monitoring)

The _/api/webserver/monitoring_ endpoint exposes aggregrated performance data for the web server. These data points include networking, CPU, memory, HTTP requests, and caching. With the exception of some properties such as *system\_in\_use*, all data is scoped down to the web server. For instance, *private\_working\_set* only includes memory used by webserver worker processes.

### Example

Web Server Monitoring Resource
```
{
    "id": "{id}",
    "network": {
        "bytes_sent_sec": "59486",

## Web Site Monitoring (/api/webserver/websites/monitoring/{id})

The _/api/webserver/websites/monitoring_ endpoint exposes performance data for an individual web site. The data is similar to what is available from the web server monitoring resource.

**Note:** This data includes information from the application pool that the web site runs in. If multiple web sites are running in the same application pool, the web site data taken from the application pool may be invalid. Assign one site per application pool for accurate performance measurement at the web site level.

### Example

Web Site Monitoring Resource
```

    "id": "{id}",
    "uptime": "88170",
    "network": {
        "bytes_sent_sec": "31280",

### Field Explanations

Most of the fields are the same as the web server resource. A few additional fields are present as indicated below.

uptime: The number of seconds that have elapsed since the web site started.

website: The web site resource that the data belongs to.

## Application Pool Monitoring (/api/webserver/application-pools/monitoring/{id})

The _/api/webserver/application-pools/monitoring_ endpoint exposes performance data for an individual application pool. The data is similar to what is available from the web server monitoring resource. Some properties present in the web server are not available in the context of an application pool.
